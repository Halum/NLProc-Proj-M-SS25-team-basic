# RAG Performance Dashboard

A Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing and analyzing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system performance metrics.

## Overview

This dashboard helps analyze the performance of a RAG system by providing insights into:

1. **Answer Accuracy:** Visualizing how often the system produces correct answers
2. **Retrieval Quality:** Analyzing similarity scores and retrieved document relevance
3. **BERT & ROUGE Scores:** Evaluating the semantic similarity between generated and gold standard answers
4. **Query Analysis:** Examining individual queries and their performance

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts and graphs for exploring performance metrics
- **Detailed Query Explorer:** In-depth analysis of individual queries
- **Metrics Analysis:** Statistical analysis of system performance
- **Responsive UI:** Well-organized interface that adapts to different screen sizes

## Requirements

This dashboard requires the following Python packages:
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly

## Getting Started

To run the dashboard:

1. Ensure you have all required packages installed:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   streamlit run specialization/streamlit/app.py
   ```

3. The dashboard will open in your default web browser.

## Data Source

The dashboard reads evaluation insights data from `specialization/data/insight/evaluation_insights.json`, which is generated by the RAG system's evaluation pipeline.

## Adding New Features

To add new visualizations or analyses:

1. Create a new component in the `components/` directory
2. Import and use it in `app.py` or add a new page in the `pages/` directory
3. Update this README to document the new feature
