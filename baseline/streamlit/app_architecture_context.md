Context of App Architecture:
Must not change anything outside of `streamlit` directory.

## Application Structure
The application is organized using a modular pattern with separate files for different components:
- `app.py`: Main entry point that orchestrates the overall UI
- `views/`: Directory containing UI components
- `utils/`: Directory containing helper functions and state management

## Components

### Sidebar (`views/sidebar.py`):
- Contains multiselect dropdown for chunking strategies
- Includes sliders to configure strategy parameters:
  - Chunk size (100-5000 characters)
  - Overlap (for SlidingWindowChunkingStrategy)
- "Process Documents" button that changes to "Process Documents Again" after first use
- Button disables immediately on click to prevent double-processing

### Main View (Two Tabs):

#### 1. Processing Tab (`views/preprocessing_tab.py`):
- Displays information about selected chunking strategies
- Shows processing state and progress during document processing
- After processing, displays two side-by-side visualizations:
  - Number of chunks generated by each strategy
  - Processing time in milliseconds for each strategy
- Supports multiple chunking strategies:
  - FixedSizeChunkingStrategy
  - SlidingWindowChunkingStrategy
  - SentenceBasedChunkingStrategy
  - ParagraphBasedChunkingStrategy
  - SemanticChunkingStrategy
  - MarkdownHeaderChunkingStrategy

#### 2. Interaction Tab (`views/interaction_tab.py`):
- Shows sample queries from answer_verifier.py
- Allows user to select processed strategies for querying
- Includes "Ask" button to process the selected query
- Displays results in tabbed interface (one tab per strategy)
- Shows generated answer, expected answer, and context
- Visualizes insights with multiple charts once query responses are returned:
  - Number of chunks by strategy
  - Correct answer rate by strategy
  - Context found rate by strategy
  - Raw insights data in tabular form

### State Management (`utils/state.py`):
- Uses Streamlit's session state to maintain UI state between reruns
- Tracks selected strategies, processing state, and results
- Maintains chunk size, overlap, and other configuration parameters
- Stores processing times for visualization

## Backend Integration
For the implementation of RAG functionality, the app integrates with components from the `baseline/` directory:
- `preprocessor/chunking_service.py`: Different chunking strategies
- `retriever/retreiver.py`: Document retrieval functionality
- `evaluation/answer_verifier.py`: Query verification and evaluation
- `evaluation/insight_generator.py`: Generates insights from results

## Data Flow
1. User selects strategies and parameters in sidebar
2. Processing happens when "Process Documents" is clicked
3. Results are stored and visualized in the Processing tab
4. User can then interact with processed documents in the Interaction tab
5. Insights are generated and visualized after queries are processed
