In April 2025, a high-level German business delegation visited Bangladesh to explore avenues for expanding bilateral trade and investment. The delegation, comprising officials from Germany’s Foreign and Economic Ministries, export credit agencies, and international development organizations, aimed to gather insights into Bangladesh’s reform policies and investment climate.

Their visit coincided with the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025, held in Dhaka between April 7 and 10. During the event, Bangladesh presented its investment opportunities to investors through the summit, which focused on textiles, the digital economy, renewable energy, and the healthcare industries.

Germany eyes deeper trade ties with Bangladesh amid global supply chain shifts
Germany's export market holds the 2nd largest position in Bangladesh's foreign trade. In 2023, Bangladesh exported goods worth $8.28 billion to Germany, with over 90% comprising ready-made garments. Knitted or crocheted garments, cotton-made apparel, synthetic and silk fiber products, and footwear made up the most exported products. Conversely, Bangladesh imported approximately $856 million of goods from Germany. These imports comprised various items, including machinery, chemical products, textile and leather processing equipment, and medical devices. Bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to approximately $9.8 billion in 2023.

Trade between the two countries has achieved significant growth day by day. In December 2024, Germany imported $732 million of goods from Bangladesh, marking a 51.7% year-on-year increase. During the same month, Germany exported $81.4 million of goods to Bangladesh—a 32.3% increase from the previous year.

According to the German Asia-Pacific Business Association (OAV), around 80 German companies currently operate in Bangladesh. These include globally renowned firms such as BASF, Bayer, Bosch, and Siemens. Several German companies are active in the garment and leather sectors, and some have even established local production facilities.

Thomas Caning, CEO of OSPIG GmbH and a delegation member, commented, “As an emerging market, Bangladesh’s stability is truly commendable. Key macroeconomic indicators and other factors appear promising for potential investors.”

Among the early investors, Thomas Caning’s company OSPIG manufactures high-quality jeans and jackets employing thousands of workers. Another German brand, Picard, has been producing handbags and accessories in Bangladesh since 1995.

On April 2 of 2025, Donald Trump imposed a 37% tariff on products imported from Bangladesh. Although he announced a 90-day waiver for most trade partners, the policy shift had already affected Bangladeshi suppliers and their existing order flows.

Last year, Bangladesh exported around $8.4 billion worth of goods to the U.S., of which $7.34 billion came from the apparel sector. Approximately 80% of Bangladesh’s total exports come from the textile and apparel industry. While the U.S. imposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods and attempts to restructure global economic rules, Bangladesh sees an opportunity to attract foreign investments, particularly from those seeking alternatives to China.

Masrur Reza, economist and CEO of the Think Tank Policy Exchange Bangladesh, agreed with this perspective. He referred to the current situation as “a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”

He said, “To capitalize on this opportunity, the Bangladeshi government must act swiftly. It needs to revise outdated regulations, address trade-related transport issues, and enhance productivity through skills and technology.”

German businessman Thomas Caning noted, “Geopolitical shifts and increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are pushing German companies to search for alternative production hubs.” He further added, “In light of the need for diversification and the recent tariff disruptions, Bangladesh could emerge as an alternative to China for manufacturing consumer goods, electronics, household items, and industrial components. Despite existing challenges, Bangladesh’s success in the garment sector proves the country can achieve similar progress in other industries as well.”

The economic prospects of Bangladesh maintain a positive outlook in the assessment of German investors. German Asia-Pacific Business Association (OAV) Executive Board Member Almut Rösner emphasizes that Bangladesh maintains attractive investment prospects, although some investors decided to wait and observe Bangladesh's political conditions.

The German government demonstrates its intensive commitment to help Bangladesh achieve progress throughout its development process. The 2024 plan from Germany mentions funding biodiversity conservation and climate-proof urban development initiatives through $10.36 million while providing $197.1 million in budget support and technical assistance programs.

According to a recent World Bank report, major obstacles to investment in Bangladesh include power shortages, limited access to financing, and corruption. German investors are aware of these issues but believe that, despite the challenges, Bangladesh’s competitive capacity has significantly improved. Bangladesh's future economic growth will develop through the fast adaptation of shifting global supply chains along with innovative implementation strategies. The solution of structural market problems alongside increased ties with German traders will help Bangladesh secure major international investments and maintain better market performance in the textile business.
