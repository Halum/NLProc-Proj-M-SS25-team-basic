German healthcare compared to the USA: Cultural differences and preparation tips for foreigners
Healthcare is one of the most crucial issues when it comes to living in a new country. There are profound differences in the healthcare system, particularly between Germany and the USA, which are not only structural but also cultural in nature. For people moving to Germany from the USA, whether for work, study or longer stays, it can be helpful to familiarise themselves with these differences. In this blog post, we highlight the most important differences and provide tips on how foreigners can prepare for the German system

1. Compulsory insurance in Germany vs. freedom in the USA
One of the most striking differences between the two healthcare systems is the way in which insurance cover is organised. In Germany, health insurance is compulsory: everyone who lives or works in Germany must have either statutory or private health insurance. This ensures that everyone has access to medical care in the event of illness.

In the USA, on the other hand, there is no obligation to have health insurance. The system is heavily based on private insurance, which is often offered by employers. Those who do not have insurance through their employer must take out a private policy themselves or be covered by state programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. The high proportion of people without health insurance (especially before the Affordable Care Act was introduced) was a defining feature of the US system for a long time.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Find out about statutory and private health insurance in Germany and decide which option is best for you.

With its ISHCP TARIF and ISHCP-STT TARIF, the IHC Company offers very good health insurance cover for international scholarship holders, as well as for foreign students, doctoral students, visiting academics, prize winners and language students. You can find detailed information on the various tariffs here on the website.

2. Costs and co-payments: A crucial difference
Medical costs in the USA can be staggeringly high. A visit to the doctor or hospital treatment without insurance can cost several thousand dollars. Even with insurance, there are often considerable co-payments and deductibles that patients have to pay.

In Germany, on the other hand, health insurance (whether statutory or private) covers the majority of treatment costs. Co-payments are comparatively low and there are upper limits for the burden of such co-payments. The German system therefore offers more financial security for the individual, and there is generally less concern about enormous costs in the event of illness than in the USA.

How foreigners can prepare:

– Expect lower financial burdens from the healthcare system in Germany, but make sure you find out about co-payments (e.g. for medication or dentures).

– For US citizens who are used to high co-payments, the German system can be a welcome relief.

3. Access to doctors: GP model vs. specialisation in the USA
A key difference between the German and US healthcare systems is the way in which patients access specialists and medical services. In Germany, the family doctor plays a key role. The GP is often the first point of contact for health problems and can refer patients to specialists if necessary. This GP model is designed to coordinate medical care and avoid overprovision.

In the US, on the other hand, there is more flexibility to see specialists directly without consulting a GP first. However, these decisions often depend on the type of insurance, and in some cases referrals must be obtained even in the USA, especially in so-called HMO plans (Health Maintenance Organisations).

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Be prepared for the fact that in Germany you will need to see a family doctor first before getting an appointment with a specialist.

– For US citizens who are used to seeing their specialists directly, this can be unfamiliar at first, but the system ensures a structured treatment process.

4. Pharmaceutical care and medication costs
Another major difference between Germany and the USA is the supply of medication. In the USA, many people have the problem that medication is often very expensive. Prices for prescription drugs can vary greatly, and it is not uncommon for patients to have to pay large sums for essential medications.

In Germany, on the other hand, the prices of medicines are strictly regulated. Many prescription drugs are significantly cheaper and most of them are covered by health insurance. The distribution of medicines is also organised differently: While in the USA many medications, such as painkillers, are freely available, in Germany many of these medications require a prescription.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– If you regularly need certain medications, bring enough supplies with you until you get a new prescription in Germany.

– Be prepared that you may need a prescription in Germany for medications that are freely available in the US.

5. Patient rights and self-determination
An important cultural element in the German healthcare system is the high value placed on patient rights and self-determination. Patients have the right to comprehensive information about their illnesses and treatment options and must generally be actively involved in decisions about their healthcare. This means that doctors in Germany spend a lot of time counselling their patients.

In the USA, on the other hand, the type of patient information varies greatly. Although the right to information also exists there, how much responsibility is left to the patient can vary from doctor to doctor.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Prepare yourself for having to take an active role in your healthcare in Germany.

– Make sure you understand all the information and take the opportunity to ask questions before agreeing to treatment.

Conclusion
The German healthcare system offers comprehensive cover and places great emphasis on prevention and patient rights. For people from the US, it may initially feel very structured and highly regulated, particularly in terms of compulsory insurance and the role of the GP. However, it offers significant financial benefits compared to the US, as treatment costs are better controlled and access to healthcare is more universal. Thorough preparation for the German system and the differences in doctor-patient communication can help you quickly adapt to the new environment.
