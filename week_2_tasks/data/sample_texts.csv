1,eating_behaviour.txt,"A healthy diet plays a key role in preventing obesity and non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. This is true for all age groups, including young adults. While unhealthy eating habits among young adults, in particular university students, have been identified in former studies, this group has been neglected in existing health promotion strategies. Our aim was to explore baseline dietary intake, common barriers to healthy eating, and changes in eating behaviour among university students since the time of matriculation. We used data from the quantitative part of the Nutrition and Physical Activity Study (NuPhA), a cross-sectional online survey (data collection: 2014/10/31–2015/01/15). Students were recruited from all over Germany. Overall, 689 university students (30.5% male; mean age: 22.69) from more than 40 universities across Germany participated. We found that there is room for improvement with regard to the consumption of specific food groups, for example, fruits and vegetables. The main barriers to healthy eating were lack of time due to studies, lack of healthy meals at the university canteen, and high prices of healthy foods. Cluster analysis revealed that barriers to healthy eating might affect only specific subgroups, for instance freshmen. Changes in eating behaviour since matriculation were found in the consumption of meat, fish, and regular meals. Future qualitative studies may help to explore why university students change their eating behaviour since the time of matriculation. Such knowledge is necessary to inform health promotion strategies in the university setting.
Introduction
A healthy diet is widely recognized as a main factor in preventing obesity and non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (World Health Organisation, 2016). Therefore, following a healthy diet should be promoted across all age groups. According to the WHO (2016) a healthy diet should include, for instance, high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in addition to low consumption of saturated fats, salt, and refined carbohydrates. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood may be a particularly important time for health promotion strategies, including the promotion of healthy eating, because many health behaviours are developed and established during this period (Nelson et al., 2008, Poobalan et al., 2014). However, current studies indicate that poor dietary habits seem to be common among this age group. Former studies report, for example, high levels of fast food consumption, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and breakfast skipping (Larson et al., 2012, Niemeier et al., 2006). Furthermore, excessive weight gain has been observed among young adults (Gordon-Larsen et al., 2004, Mensink et al., 2013, Nelson Laska et al., 2010), particularly university students (Mihalopoulos et al., 2008, Racette et al., 2005).
The transition from school to university coincides changing living arrangements, which might also result in a reorientation of eating behaviours (El Ansari, Stock, & Mikolajczyk, 2012). However, only a few studies have focused on potential changes in eating behaviour since matriculation (Lupi et al., 2015, Nelson Laska et al., 2010, Wengreen and Moncur, 2009). In addition, little is known about the reasons which may prevent university students from following a healthy diet. Thus, we aimed to a) describe the baseline dietary intake of university students, b) identify potential barriers to healthy eating and c) explore potential changes in their eating behaviour since the time of matriculation.

Study design and sample
The analyses are based on data from the quantitative part of the Nutrition and Physical Activity Study (NuPhA), a cross-sectional online survey among university students conducted across Germany from October 2014 to January 2015. University students were recruited via fliers, mailing lists, social networks, and advertising the study during classes and lectures. Students received information on the study aims and data security regulations; they were informed that participation was voluntary and
Results
The sample included 689 university students (30.5% male; Table 1) aged 16–29 years from more than 40 universities across Germany. Approximately 35% of them were undergraduate students in the first to third semesters. The majority of the students (74.2%) had left their hometown to enrol at university.
Discussion
In our nationwide NuPhA Study we found that there is room for improvement with regard to the intake of specific food groups like fruits and vegetables. The main barriers to healthy eating were identified as lack of time due to studies, lack of healthy food at the university canteen, and high costs of healthy foods. In addition, most of the students reported changes in eating behaviour since matriculation.
According to the WHO (2016) a healthy diet includes the consumption of at least five
Conclusion
The results of our study indicate that changes in eating behaviour occur among university students since the time of matriculation. However, barriers to healthy eating may differ among university students and seem to affect only specific subgroups, for instance freshmen. Qualitative studies may be helpful to further explore the motives that shape the changes in eating behaviour since the time of matriculation. Such knowledge is necessary to inform health promotion strategies that enable healthy

2,global_supply_chain.txt,"In April 2025, a high-level German business delegation visited Bangladesh to explore avenues for expanding bilateral trade and investment. The delegation, comprising officials from Germany’s Foreign and Economic Ministries, export credit agencies, and international development organizations, aimed to gather insights into Bangladesh’s reform policies and investment climate.

Their visit coincided with the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025, held in Dhaka between April 7 and 10. During the event, Bangladesh presented its investment opportunities to investors through the summit, which focused on textiles, the digital economy, renewable energy, and the healthcare industries.

Germany eyes deeper trade ties with Bangladesh amid global supply chain shifts
Germany's export market holds the 2nd largest position in Bangladesh's foreign trade. In 2023, Bangladesh exported goods worth $8.28 billion to Germany, with over 90% comprising ready-made garments. Knitted or crocheted garments, cotton-made apparel, synthetic and silk fiber products, and footwear made up the most exported products. Conversely, Bangladesh imported approximately $856 million of goods from Germany. These imports comprised various items, including machinery, chemical products, textile and leather processing equipment, and medical devices. Bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to approximately $9.8 billion in 2023.

Trade between the two countries has achieved significant growth day by day. In December 2024, Germany imported $732 million of goods from Bangladesh, marking a 51.7% year-on-year increase. During the same month, Germany exported $81.4 million of goods to Bangladesh—a 32.3% increase from the previous year.

According to the German Asia-Pacific Business Association (OAV), around 80 German companies currently operate in Bangladesh. These include globally renowned firms such as BASF, Bayer, Bosch, and Siemens. Several German companies are active in the garment and leather sectors, and some have even established local production facilities.

Thomas Caning, CEO of OSPIG GmbH and a delegation member, commented, “As an emerging market, Bangladesh’s stability is truly commendable. Key macroeconomic indicators and other factors appear promising for potential investors.”

Among the early investors, Thomas Caning’s company OSPIG manufactures high-quality jeans and jackets employing thousands of workers. Another German brand, Picard, has been producing handbags and accessories in Bangladesh since 1995.

On April 2 of 2025, Donald Trump imposed a 37% tariff on products imported from Bangladesh. Although he announced a 90-day waiver for most trade partners, the policy shift had already affected Bangladeshi suppliers and their existing order flows.

Last year, Bangladesh exported around $8.4 billion worth of goods to the U.S., of which $7.34 billion came from the apparel sector. Approximately 80% of Bangladesh’s total exports come from the textile and apparel industry. While the U.S. imposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods and attempts to restructure global economic rules, Bangladesh sees an opportunity to attract foreign investments, particularly from those seeking alternatives to China.

Masrur Reza, economist and CEO of the Think Tank Policy Exchange Bangladesh, agreed with this perspective. He referred to the current situation as “a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”

He said, “To capitalize on this opportunity, the Bangladeshi government must act swiftly. It needs to revise outdated regulations, address trade-related transport issues, and enhance productivity through skills and technology.”

German businessman Thomas Caning noted, “Geopolitical shifts and increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are pushing German companies to search for alternative production hubs.” He further added, “In light of the need for diversification and the recent tariff disruptions, Bangladesh could emerge as an alternative to China for manufacturing consumer goods, electronics, household items, and industrial components. Despite existing challenges, Bangladesh’s success in the garment sector proves the country can achieve similar progress in other industries as well.”

The economic prospects of Bangladesh maintain a positive outlook in the assessment of German investors. German Asia-Pacific Business Association (OAV) Executive Board Member Almut Rösner emphasizes that Bangladesh maintains attractive investment prospects, although some investors decided to wait and observe Bangladesh's political conditions.

The German government demonstrates its intensive commitment to help Bangladesh achieve progress throughout its development process. The 2024 plan from Germany mentions funding biodiversity conservation and climate-proof urban development initiatives through $10.36 million while providing $197.1 million in budget support and technical assistance programs.

According to a recent World Bank report, major obstacles to investment in Bangladesh include power shortages, limited access to financing, and corruption. German investors are aware of these issues but believe that, despite the challenges, Bangladesh’s competitive capacity has significantly improved. Bangladesh's future economic growth will develop through the fast adaptation of shifting global supply chains along with innovative implementation strategies. The solution of structural market problems alongside increased ties with German traders will help Bangladesh secure major international investments and maintain better market performance in the textile business.",Why is Germany showing growing interest in doing business with Bangladesh?,"Because Bangladesh is becoming an attractive trade and investment partner, especially as companies look for alternatives to China.",What makes Bangladesh appealing to German companies in today’s global economy?,Global supply chain changes and Bangladesh’s growing industrial capacity make it a promising alternative to China for German businesses.,Why did a high-level German business delegation visit Bangladesh in April 2025?,"They aimed to explore trade and investment opportunities, as Bangladesh is seen as a potential alternative to China in key manufacturing sectors.",How are geopolitical shifts influencing Germany’s trade strategy regarding Bangladesh?,"Due to rising tariffs on Chinese goods and global supply chain disruptions, Germany sees Bangladesh as a strategic partner for diversifying production and expanding trade.",What factors contribute to Bangladesh’s rising profile in Germany’s long-term economic planning and investment decisions?,"Bangladesh’s proven success in garments, low production costs, potential for sectoral expansion, and shifting global trade dynamics position it as a strong alternative to China for German investors.","Germany is strengthening trade and investment ties with Bangladesh, especially as global supply chains shift and Bangladesh emerges as a strong alternative to China in sectors like garments, electronics, and manufacturing."
3,healthcare_comparison.txt,"German healthcare compared to the USA: Cultural differences and preparation tips for foreigners
Healthcare is one of the most crucial issues when it comes to living in a new country. There are profound differences in the healthcare system, particularly between Germany and the USA, which are not only structural but also cultural in nature. For people moving to Germany from the USA, whether for work, study or longer stays, it can be helpful to familiarise themselves with these differences. In this blog post, we highlight the most important differences and provide tips on how foreigners can prepare for the German system

1. Compulsory insurance in Germany vs. freedom in the USA
One of the most striking differences between the two healthcare systems is the way in which insurance cover is organised. In Germany, health insurance is compulsory: everyone who lives or works in Germany must have either statutory or private health insurance. This ensures that everyone has access to medical care in the event of illness.

In the USA, on the other hand, there is no obligation to have health insurance. The system is heavily based on private insurance, which is often offered by employers. Those who do not have insurance through their employer must take out a private policy themselves or be covered by state programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. The high proportion of people without health insurance (especially before the Affordable Care Act was introduced) was a defining feature of the US system for a long time.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Find out about statutory and private health insurance in Germany and decide which option is best for you.

With its ISHCP TARIF and ISHCP-STT TARIF, the IHC Company offers very good health insurance cover for international scholarship holders, as well as for foreign students, doctoral students, visiting academics, prize winners and language students. You can find detailed information on the various tariffs here on the website.

2. Costs and co-payments: A crucial difference
Medical costs in the USA can be staggeringly high. A visit to the doctor or hospital treatment without insurance can cost several thousand dollars. Even with insurance, there are often considerable co-payments and deductibles that patients have to pay.

In Germany, on the other hand, health insurance (whether statutory or private) covers the majority of treatment costs. Co-payments are comparatively low and there are upper limits for the burden of such co-payments. The German system therefore offers more financial security for the individual, and there is generally less concern about enormous costs in the event of illness than in the USA.

How foreigners can prepare:

– Expect lower financial burdens from the healthcare system in Germany, but make sure you find out about co-payments (e.g. for medication or dentures).

– For US citizens who are used to high co-payments, the German system can be a welcome relief.

3. Access to doctors: GP model vs. specialisation in the USA
A key difference between the German and US healthcare systems is the way in which patients access specialists and medical services. In Germany, the family doctor plays a key role. The GP is often the first point of contact for health problems and can refer patients to specialists if necessary. This GP model is designed to coordinate medical care and avoid overprovision.

In the US, on the other hand, there is more flexibility to see specialists directly without consulting a GP first. However, these decisions often depend on the type of insurance, and in some cases referrals must be obtained even in the USA, especially in so-called HMO plans (Health Maintenance Organisations).

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Be prepared for the fact that in Germany you will need to see a family doctor first before getting an appointment with a specialist.

– For US citizens who are used to seeing their specialists directly, this can be unfamiliar at first, but the system ensures a structured treatment process.

4. Pharmaceutical care and medication costs
Another major difference between Germany and the USA is the supply of medication. In the USA, many people have the problem that medication is often very expensive. Prices for prescription drugs can vary greatly, and it is not uncommon for patients to have to pay large sums for essential medications.

In Germany, on the other hand, the prices of medicines are strictly regulated. Many prescription drugs are significantly cheaper and most of them are covered by health insurance. The distribution of medicines is also organised differently: While in the USA many medications, such as painkillers, are freely available, in Germany many of these medications require a prescription.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– If you regularly need certain medications, bring enough supplies with you until you get a new prescription in Germany.

– Be prepared that you may need a prescription in Germany for medications that are freely available in the US.

5. Patient rights and self-determination
An important cultural element in the German healthcare system is the high value placed on patient rights and self-determination. Patients have the right to comprehensive information about their illnesses and treatment options and must generally be actively involved in decisions about their healthcare. This means that doctors in Germany spend a lot of time counselling their patients.

In the USA, on the other hand, the type of patient information varies greatly. Although the right to information also exists there, how much responsibility is left to the patient can vary from doctor to doctor.

How foreigners can prepare themselves:

– Prepare yourself for having to take an active role in your healthcare in Germany.

– Make sure you understand all the information and take the opportunity to ask questions before agreeing to treatment.

Conclusion
The German healthcare system offers comprehensive cover and places great emphasis on prevention and patient rights. For people from the US, it may initially feel very structured and highly regulated, particularly in terms of compulsory insurance and the role of the GP. However, it offers significant financial benefits compared to the US, as treatment costs are better controlled and access to healthcare is more universal.

4,educatin_system.txt,"What is the German Education System?
The German education system is recognised for its structured approach and strong emphasis on practical learning. It equips students with the skills needed to transition smoothly into the workforce or pursue higher academic qualifications.

One of the defining features of the German school system is early career orientation, where students follow either an academic or vocational path based on their strengths and interests. The dual education system further enhances this by combining classroom learning with hands-on industry training, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for professional roles.

Higher education in Germany is internationally respected for its focus on research, innovation and industry collaboration. With public universities charging little to no tuition fees, Germany remains an attractive destination for students seeking quality education without financial barriers. Whether choosing university study or vocational training, students gain a future-focused education that prioritises skill development and adaptability.

Overview of the German Education System
There are five stages in the education system in Germany, namely early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, tertiary education and continuing education.

Early childhood education is extended to children from the age of 0 to 6 years and is optional. Preschool education focuses on communication, writing, social and value development, and fine arts for children over two years. The aim of this education is to introduce students to everyday activities as they prepare to get integrated into society.

Primary education is provided for students from the age of seven to ten and focuses on building essential life skills in children along with the introduction of minor subjects.

Secondary education in Germany consists of two levels called lower secondary and upper secondary. Lower secondary education is for children aged ten to fifteen and is a preparation for the upper secondary classes with a special focus on providing foundational knowledge and identifying the capabilities of students. Upper secondary education, for children aged sixteen to eighteen, deals with more complex topics as it prepares students for university education or vocational training.

Tertiary education is the higher education system in Germany where you can study in different types of universities which can lead to finding a profession in your field of interest. This stage of your education focuses on skill development in a particular subject area that prepares you for careers in the respective fields.

Continuing education is meant for professionals who wish to upskill themselves as part of career growth or change.

How Does the German Education System Work?
Education in Germany follows a structured yet flexible model, allowing students to tailor their learning journey to their strengths and ambitions. From an early stage, the German school system encourages independent thinking and hands-on experience, ensuring students are well-prepared for future careers.

At the secondary level, students are placed into different school types based on academic performance and career goals. Those aiming for university typically attend a Gymnasium, while students pursuing technical or vocational careers follow paths such as Realschule or Hauptschule, with opportunities to transition into apprenticeships or further study.

Higher education institutions focus on practical application and research-driven learning. Many universities collaborate with industry partners, offering internships, project-based courses and real-world case studies. Meanwhile, the dual education system integrates formal study with workplace training, helping students gain industry experience while earning a qualification.

Since education is overseen at the state level, variations exist across Germany, but the core principles remain the same: academic excellence, career readiness and accessibility.

What Makes the German Education System World-Renowned?
The quality of the education in Germany is unmatched and offers numerous growth opportunities for students internationally. Here are some of the factors that make the Germany education system unique:

opportunities in the gaming industry
Dual study programmes
The dual education system is a unique aspect of Germany education system, where equal focus is given to theoretical and practical learning. Students enrolled in a dual study programme will complete their academic lessons from the university while getting vocational training from a company with which the university has a partnership.

Through dual study programmes, you will get opportunities to apply and develop your skills in a practical setting while also earning a stipend. This exposure gives a competitive advantage in the labour market and presents numerous career opportunities.

Research and innovation
The curriculum in the German education system is focused on innovation and research and provides opportunities for skill development. The country offers some outstanding research opportunities for students and has even partnered with several organisations to foster application-oriented research.

Affordable tuition
An appealing factor of education in Germany is the low tuition fees. Education in Germany is free in all public schools and universities whereas private universities only charge a minimal amount as tuition fee compared to several other countries. This makes education more affordable and accessible to different people.

The German education system serves as a model for countries that seek to create a well-rounded, inclusive, and future-oriented educational environment that prepares students for academic success and skill development.

Grading System in the German Education System
The German grading system differs from many other countries, using a scale from 1.0 (excellent) to 6.0 (insufficient). Unlike traditional percentage-based assessments, this system evaluates students based on their performance relative to learning objectives.

1.0 – 1.5: Excellent (Sehr gut) 
1.6 – 2.5: Good (Gut) 
2.6 – 3.5: Satisfactory (Befriedigend) 
3.6 – 4.0: Sufficient (Ausreichend) 
4.1 – 6.0: Insufficient/Fail (Nicht bestanden)
In universities, students are often assessed through a combination of written exams, oral presentations, and project-bas

Conclusion
The Germany education system serves as a model for countries that seek to create a well-rounded, inclusive, and future-oriented educational environment that prepares students for academic success and skill development.

5,student_accommodation.txt,"Student dormitory for study abroad
A dorm room is a popular form of study accommodation, but there are other options as well.

A typical study abroad accommodation is dormitories at foreign universities. Many German universities maintain such accommodation type for students, but not all do. Student dorms can be located directly on the university campus or off-campus.

Living in a dormitory on campus
Especially with dormitories directly on campus, students benefit from having all the university's facilities, such as lecture halls and course rooms, close by. All the important contacts are also close by. It is also not far from the dining halls or food courts and the university's own sports facilities. Those who like to take advantage of the recreational opportunities at the university do not have to plan for a long drive. Living on campus is a great opportunity to experience the typical campus life itself.

Student dormitories offer a good opportunity to quickly make new contacts with other students, especially at the beginning of your study abroad program. However, you cannot always choose your roommates. If you want to live in a student residence, you should have a certain amount of tolerance. For example, it could get a bit noisy at a party in the dormitory. In student dormitories, students usually have to abide by certain rules. These relate, for example, to nighttime rest or the use of alcohol. Therefore, it does not hurt to inform yourself about the house rules of the dormitory before renting a room.

Renting a room in a student dormitory
A room in a student dormitory can be easily organized before you leave. Therefore, the dormitory is well suited as accommodation for students who would like to have a permanent place to stay even before arriving in the country of study. It is advisable to apply for a dormitory room as early as possible. The application deadlines for dormitory rooms vary depending on the university.

Costs of living in a dormitory in Germany
When it comes to the price of dorm rooms, the following often applies: the closer the dorm is to the university, the higher the rent. Exactly how expensive a dorm room is cannot be said across the board. It depends on the city of study, university, dormitory, and type of room. Many dormitories offer single and double rooms with or without a bathroom and sometimes also with a common kitchen for several rooms. It is also not uncommon for the university to rent fully furnished apartments that several students can share. The more ""luxurious"" the accommodation in the dormitory is, for example, in terms of size, number of beds, and furnishings, the more expensive it usually is. The rent usually already includes utilities such as electricity and gas.

Advantages and disadvantages of the student residence at a glance
Advantages:

Booking a room in the dormitory can be done from your home country
Incidental costs are usually included in the rent
Meals could be booked in addition
Quick socializing with other students
Short distances
Low transportation costs
Campus life
Disadvantages

Partly more expensive than other accommodation options such as a shared apartment
Partly no own cooking facilities and obligatory meal plan
Often greater distance to the (inner) city
Amount of other residents
Stricter rules than in a shared apartment or your own apartment
 

Shared apartment or own apartment while studying in Germany
If you decide against living in a dormitory for your studies in Germany, you can look for private accommodation. Those who prefer to be on their own will definitely feel comfortable in their own apartment. However, moving into a rented apartment alone is the most expensive accommodation option for international students.

Many students choose to live in a private shared apartment (Wohngemeinschaft, WG) while studying in Germany. It is common for students to either become the new flatmate in an existing shared apartment or start a new shared apartment with others.

Each person has individual criteria to find a suitable apartment for their study or semester abroad. Location is an important criterion. Some prefer an apartment near the university. Others would rather live near the city center.

Those who would like to live in private accommodation while studying abroad should know that it is not always possible to rent a furnished apartment. Thus, additional costs may arise from the purchase of new furniture. Usually, there are additional costs to the rent, such as electricity and gas.

 

Searching for accommodation in Germany for students
When looking for accommodation while studying in Germany, it is advisable to get an overview of the housing market in the respective city before departure. Students can already find out what the apartments look like, how high the rents are, and what they get for what rent price. Of course, the rent level always depends on the city of study and the apartment's location.

It is strongly discouraged to sign a rental contract from your home country and make a down payment for an apartment or a shared room. Be aware of housing scams, as they are pretty common in big cities, such as Berlin and Munich. Students renting an apartment that they have not inspected on-site are taking a risk. If you are on-site, it is much easier to call landlords in response to advertisements and make spontaneous appointments to view apartments.

Students who want to look for an apartment locally should, if possible, arrive before the start of the semester. This way, the apartment search does not collide with the first weeks at university, and you can start studying in Germany in a more relaxed way. Many international students choose a hostel as their first place to stay while they are looking for accommodation.

In some cases, your university helps you find private accommodation for studying in Germany.

Advantages and disadvantages of a shared or single apartment while studying abroad
Advantages:

Privacy
Apartment in a preferred location, such as near the beach or city center 
More personal freedom and independence than in a student residence or host family 
Possibility to get to know the life in the study country away from the campus
Disadvantages:

Apartment search only possible on-site
Longer distance to the university and associated transportation costs
Less contact with other students
In addition to the rent, there are also other costs
 

Accommodation in a host family while studying abroad
Another option for living while studying abroad is a host family, also known as a homestay. Those who choose this option live with a local host while studying abroad. This can be more than just a ""traditional"" family with children. An elderly couple, for example, or even a single person can also offer a homestay. Those who would like to host students as host families are usually checked in advance by homestay organizations. International universities are often helpful in finding a suitable host family.

Students usually have their own room and often their own bathroom in the host family and can use the kitchen. The rent usually includes utilities and sometimes also meals. This makes host families a fairly inexpensive option for living while studying abroad.

Living with a host family while studying abroad is a great way to get to know the country and its people even better. Students can experience the culture and daily life of the locals up close. In some host families, students even have a real family connection and get to experience even more of everyday life.

The development of foreign language skills is not neglected during a stay with a host family. Those who study abroad in the USA, Australia, or Great Britain are encouraged to speak English away from the university. This is also the case in shared flats and student residences, as long as you do not only live with compatriots. Students who study mainly in English at a university in a Spanish-speaking country like Spain, Peru, or Chile, for example, can improve their Spanish in the host family and their English at the university. This way, they kill two birds with one stone.

Students who decide to study abroad with a host family should keep in mind that these families do not necessarily always live in the immediate vicinity of the university or city center. As a guest, students should of course also abide by certain rules of the house. This can be particularly unfamiliar for students who have already lived alone.

Host families as an accommodation option when studying abroad: advantages and disadvantages
Advantages:

Get to know the country and its people 
Improve language skills 
Utilities and meals are often included in the rent 
Family connection
Disadvantages:

Transportation costs to the university
You have to abide by the rules set by the family
Often greater distance from the city center, as host families live in residential areas
 

For a short time: stay in a hostel or hotel
A hostel or hotel is only suitable as short-term accommodation at the beginning of the study abroad program because of the costs, among other things. Sometimes, however, there are special offers for students at certain times. Hostels are a popular temporary solution for students who want to find a permanent place to stay after arriving in their study country. Some of these accommodations are particularly frequented by international students to make initial contacts here.
