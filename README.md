## Overview
This repository hosts the code for a semester-long project on building and experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Students start with a shared baseline and then explore specialized variations in teams.

## Overall Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop and analyze various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to understand how different chunking strategies and retrieval methods impact the performance and accuracy of AI assistants. By comparing approaches such as fixed-size chunking, sliding window, semantic chunking, and others, this project aims to identify optimal configurations for various document types and query scenarios.

In later phase, extend the baseline RAG application to a certain specialization.

## Structure
- `baseline/`: Common starter system (retriever + generator)
  - `config/`: Configuration settings for the RAG system
  - `data/`: Holds different kinds of data files
    - `db/`: Vector databases and indexes
    - `insight/`: Storage for analytics data from experiments
    - `raw/`: Original input text files
    - `tests/`: Test data for system validation
  - `evaluation/`: Tools for evaluating retriever and generator performance
  - `generator/`: Text generation components using LLMs
  - `postprocessor/`: Output formatting and document writing tools
  - `preprocessor/`: Document reading and text chunking services
  - `retriever/`: Vector store and retrieval components
  - `pipeline.py`: Main execution script for the RAG pipeline
- `evaluation/`: Common tools for comparing results
- `homeworks/`: Weekly assignment results and observations
  - `week_2/`: Analysis of RAG system behavior with various questions
  - `week_3/`: Comparison of different chunking strategies
- `utils/`: Helper functions shared across code

## Environment Setup with Conda

For a more controlled environment, we recommend using Conda:

1. **Install Miniconda**
   - Download Miniconda from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

2. **Create a Conda Environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n rag-project python=3.12
   conda activate rag-project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Management**
   - Activate environment: `conda activate rag-project`
   - Deactivate environment: `conda deactivate`
   - List environments: `conda env list`

5. **Running the Baseline Pipeline**
   ```bash
   python baseline/pipeline.py
   ```

6. **Managing Dependencies**
   - Whenever you install a new package, update requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip-chill > requirements.txt
   ```
   - This ensures that only direct dependencies (not sub-dependencies) are listed in requirements.txt


## How to Use

### Using the Streamlit UI

The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit application that provides an interactive way to explore different chunking strategies for RAG:

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit/app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate the app's interface**:
   - **Preprocessing Tab**: Select and configure chunking strategies, process documents, and view results
   - **Interaction Tab**: Ask questions and compare answers across different chunking strategies
   - **Chat Tab**: Interact with the RAG system in a conversational manner
   - **Insights Tab**: Analyze performance metrics and visualizations of different strategies

3. **Exploring chunking strategies**:
   - Select one or more strategies from the sidebar (Fixed Size, Sliding Window, Sentence-Based, etc.)
   - Adjust parameters like chunk size and overlap using the provided sliders
   - Process documents with the selected strategies and compare their performance

4. **Evaluating results**:
   - Use predefined sample questions or enter your own queries
   - Compare the answers generated using different strategies
   - Analyze metrics like correctness rate and context retrieval success

### Using the Command Line Interface

For programmatic use or batch processing, you can run the RAG pipeline directly from the command line:

1. **Run the baseline pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python baseline/pipeline.py
   ```

2. **Options and configurations**:
   - Use the `--withindex` flag to load existing vector indexes: `python baseline/pipeline.py --withindex`

3. **Viewing results**:
   - The pipeline outputs query results, expected and generated answers, and context information
   - Retrieval statistics and performance metrics are displayed in the terminal
   - Insights are saved automatically for later analysis

## ðŸ›  Development Guidelines

To maintain a clean and collaborative development workflow, please follow the guidelines below.

### Task Flow

1. **Create an Issue**  
   Open an issue **before starting any new task** to track progress and discussion.

2. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Submit all work as a pull request (PR) targeting the `develop` branch.

### Branching Strategy

- **Target Branch for Marge:** `develop`

Important: **Do not merge directly into the `main` branch.**

#### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature Branches**  
  Format: `feature/<issue_number>-<short_description>`

  Example:  `feature/1-add-10-sample-texts`

- **Bugfix Branches**  
Format: `bugfix/<issue_number>-<short_description>`

    Example: `bugfix/42-fix-translation-error`

#### Commit Message Conventions

- Format: `#-<issue_number> <Message in present tense>`
   
   Example: `#3 - Update .gitignore to ignore vscode configs`
- Try to do incremental and modular commit. Do not dump all changes into a single commit.

---

### Coding Guideline

   - Do not use hardcoded values in code. Put them in `config`
   - Ensure decoupled function or pure functions so that most of the configuration are passed as argument and it becomes reusable.
   - Focus more on readable code than efficiency.
