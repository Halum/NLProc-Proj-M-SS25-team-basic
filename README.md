# RAG Project â€“ Summer Semester 2025

## Overview
This repository hosts the code for a semester-long project on building and experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Students start with a shared baseline and then explore specialized variations in teams.

## Structure
- `baseline/`: Common starter system (retriever + generator)
- `experiments/`: Each team's independent exploration
- `evaluation/`: Common tools for comparing results
- `utils/`: Helper functions shared across code

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd baseline/`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`

## Teams & Tracks

  Example:  `feature/1-add-10-sample-texts`

- **Bugfix Branches**  
Format: `bugfix/<issue_number>-<short_description>`
Example: `bugfix/42-fix-translation-error`
